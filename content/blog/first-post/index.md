This is my first post. I have been postponing blogging for a long while. The reason for that was I couldn't decide whether to create my own website or use an already provided solution.

First I thought I should use a blog solution, as a result, I would not have to make decisions over how create the website, design etc., but rather would focus on the blogging. So I used siteground with wordpress for a while, until I saw [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Fast out of the box, easy to use, powered by react and graphql. Perfect opportunity to get into graphql as a bonus.

So here to my first post, cheers !

I will be focusing mostly on Javascript and frontend development here. Feel free to follow me on twitter. For any feedback you can dm me or tweet [@emilmartinov](https://twitter.com/emilmartinov).
