This is my first post. I have been postponing blogging for a long time. The reason for that was I couldn't decide whether to create my own website or use an already provided solution.

First I thought I should use a blog solution, as a result, I would not have to make decisions over how create the website, design etc., but rather would focus on the blogging. So I used siteground with wordpress for a while. Until, I saw [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Fast out of the box, easy to use, powered by react and graphql. Perfect opportunity to get into graphql as a bonus. I had to jump in.

So why am I writing a blog. In short, I want to provide people that want to get into frontend development the resource I wish I had. Go on and check another post by me and see if you like the content. If you are curious for the long answer, continue to read.

There are a lot of frontend development resources. Although it is every kid's dream to be able to choose any candy from the candy shop, a child who is granted that wish with a limit to choose only one, is soon to discover every choice has cost of not choosing the other and idea of a chance to regret the choice paralyzes the child. I find that the reason we watch videos like `Which programming language to learn in 2019` and `Which Code Editor I am using`, is the idea that somehow if we watch enough of them we will make the right choice, we will not have the buyer's remorse once we dive in. The process of learning, starts to steal time from the learning itself. Instead, there is usually one answer to all these types of videos, it depends.

Each situation is unique and to respond to these situations you need exposure to knowledge. The more exposure you have to different situations you start to see patterns, you start to realize there are advantages and disadvantages to each approach. This creates your time as the most important resource. But the way platforms like youtube incentivizes creating content non-stop and to stick viewers to the screen as much as possible. The problem here is as a learner you need to learn a skill,

Although at first this seems like an advantage, choosing a resource becomes problematic over time and starts to take as much time as the learning itself. You might be going through videos like which programming languages to learn in 2019, or which code editor to use (I am glad VScode won that war, now I don't need to swicth between Atom, VSCode or Sublime Text), you may end up watching these more than doing the learning itself. There is a lot of information out there and youtube algorithm rewards amount of ad watched. So pumping long content is the way to monetize it. For me, learning should be to the point, so the content should be as short as possible yet comprehensive. I think that is very hard to do and

So here, I will try to provide a comprehensive dictionary in as short as possible form. I find that most programming concepts are taught in isolation. Considering how some topics are so complex and unintiutive, it makes sense. But for certain learners like myself, who has to know the bigger picture and connections between to learn a concept this creates wrong assumptions at the time of learning, since the explanation is lacking and in the long term unlearning those assumptions and learning the right ones. I will try to teach frontend development topics, connected with the bigger picture.

I will be focusing mostly on Javascript and frontend development here. I will update the posts as I have time to work on it. And the goal is to make them either short or have a comprehensive analogy. We will see how it works. Feel free to follow me on twitter. For any feedback you can dm me or tweet [@emilmartinov](https://twitter.com/emilmartinov).

So here to my first post, cheers !
