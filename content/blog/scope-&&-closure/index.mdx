Let us talk about scope first.
Scope is a mechanism in computer science to hide level of detail and localize it. What does this mean exactly ? Let's look at an example.

```js
const firstName = 'Emil' // variable declaration
const lastName = 'Martinov' // variable declaration
function myFullName(firstName, lastName) {
  // function declaration and the parameters, firstName and lastName
  return firstName + lastName // returning the arguments !!
}
console.log(myFullName()) //logging the return of myFullName
```

When I first saw code like this the first time, it was very confusing for me, seeing firstName here, firstName there and the last line. I did not understand seperation of all these same named values.

From mathematics background I could guess that functions is a placeholder for instructions, that values firstName, lastName are placeholders for what we might put into that function so that the function follows the recipe inside.

Let's take a look at what happens at that code snippet. We define our variables firstName and lastName. Then we declare our function `myFullName`. Inside the paranthesis `()`, we are creating placeholders `firstName` and `lastName`, these placeholders only exist inside our function. Think of the function declaration as a cooking recipe, and the placeholders, parameters in programming language, are our ingredients. After we tell the function its instruction `return firstName + lastName`, we are done with our recipe so we close `}` the curly bracket. Now we just finished writing the recipe, but we have not done anything with it. So at this time it is just a piece of paper with some instructions.

```js
myFullName('Emil', 'Martinov') // here we use the function
// it will return 'EmilMartinov'
```

Think of a google maps. If we think of zoom as a scope,

![Scope](./scope.jpg)

this is our global scope.

When we are running our javascript in the browser, it is running at the global scope. At that level there can be countries

If you search on google maps for Turkey, the result will zoom in from the global view to where you can see Turkey as whole. It does not show you other countries, just Turkey.

Additionally you will see that you can also see the names of the cities. Only the big ones. The map shows you the information that it thinks is relevant.

Lets zoom in to the map, for example to Istanbul. Suddenly we start to see the names of the neighbourhoods, aveneues etc. The map already has information about all these places when you first searched for Turkey, but they are not relevant. Seeing all this information would pollute the view and will make it harder for you to locate what you are searching for.

Here is an image from google maps. When you zoom out the maximum amount, it only shows the country names. This is exactly how the javascript global scope works, done. Thanks for reading.

I am kidding, we barely started. If we think of the zoom of the map as scope, each zoom has its own scope. At the global scope, we see only the countries.
