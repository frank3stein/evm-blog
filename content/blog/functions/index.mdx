Our lazy programmer John received a letter from his aunt from across the pond. Greta Pesos drew her last breath and instead of leaving her money to her ungrateful children she chose to keep it in the family and selected John as the only heir to her ex-husband's company, Mamazon. Apperantly, before divorcing Greta, Jeffrey Pesos, fell in love with another man's wife, Goldie Digmeister. After paying his wife a hefty sum of divorce settlement, because Goldie was worth it, it did not take long for Jeffrey to discover Goldie was only with him for his money. Poor Jeffrey, after another back breaking divorce was now a minority stakeholder in his company, which he built with blood and sweat, and now tears.

John is a smart guy, he now also has the money. Although most men would be happy with this result, John is miserable. The fact that he is not making use of his money in an efficient way is haunting his nights. He wakes up all the time, thinking about how much his inheritance is making bankers rich. He just could not bare the idea of him making incompetent lazy bankers rich. They were dishonoring the other lazies of the world, who were at least good at what they do and could afford to be lazy.

John decides to buy an empty factory. He figured out that in US, he could make a lot of money by making weapons. But in his town people are against owning weapons and they want to ban them because of the recent shootings. So John comes up with a plan, if bankers can trick people into giving them loads of money, he can for sure trick some townsfolk into making weapons.

Here is his master plan.

He would create small rooms in the factory. Each room would have one employee and that employee would get ingredients to build only part of the weapon. None of these rooms have any interaction with each other so therefore people working in the rooms don't talk to or know each other. He would give each employee the ingredients and exact instructions to follow to turn the ingredients to the necessary parts. Then he would take the parts and make the weapon himself. Now John could finally sleep in peace.

John has used the concept of functions and scope to create his factory. Each room represents a function on its own, independent of the other rooms. The recipe of the function is the function definition, basically the steps each function has to follow to create the desired result.

Functions are a mathematics concept, where you define it so that it takes in some variables and outputs a result. For the same given variables it always returns the same result.
