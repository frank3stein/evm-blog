Our lazy programmer John received a letter from his aunt from across the pond. Greta Pesos drew her last breath and instead of leaving her money to her ungrateful children, she chose to keep it in the family and selected John as the only heir to her ex-husband's company, Mapple. Apperantly, before divorcing Greta, Harvy Pesos, fell in love with another with a married woman, Goldie Digmeister. After paying his wife a hefty sum of divorce settlement, because Goldie was worth it, it did not take long for Harvey to discover Goldie was only with him for his money. Poor Harvy, after another back breaking divorce was now a minority stakeholder in his company, which he built with blood and sweat, and now tears.

John is a smart guy, he now also has the money. Although most men would be happy with this result, John is miserable. The fact that he is not making use of his money in an efficient way is haunting his nights. He wakes up all the time, thinking about how much his inheritance is making bankers rich. He just could not bare the idea of him making incompetent lazy bankers rich. They were dishonoring the other lazies of the world, who were at least good at what they do and could afford to be lazy.

John decides to buy an empty factory. He figured out that in US, he could make a lot of money by making weapons. But in his town people are against owning weapons and they want to ban them because of the recent shootings. So John comes up with a plan, if bankers can trick people into giving them loads of their hard owned tax money for free, he can for sure trick some townsfolk into making weapons.

Here is his master plan.

- He would create small rooms in his factory.
- Each room would be a square box, no windows and only a door.
- He would put only one employee in each room so they can not talk to each other and hand them instructions to follow to detail no matter what. The only person these employees can talk to was John in case something was missing. In this way, he only has to give the ingredients through the door and he would get a finished product after the employee was done.
- After the employees were set, he would start to bring the ingredients to a room, wait for the employee to finish their job, get the product and move on to the next room, till he went to each room.
- In the end, he would take the parts and make the weapon himself. Now John could finally sleep in peace.

John was very proud of himself. Finally that javascript book his father gave to him, paid its dues.

He was the chief global execution context. He made sure each room acted like a function, it could only get arguments in and return an output. They had no access to other functions, but John. He promoted each employee to local execution context. They had no idea all of them were sharing the same position. For them, there was only one local execution context and chief global execution context.

He would start his day by going to one room at a time, giving the ingredients. Employees would use the ingredients and do as in the instructions and return the finished product to John. Without John going to the room and giving the ingredients, the employees were just idle waiting there.

John was not satisfied, because now he had to wait infront of each room till the employees were done with the assignment. He for sure could design a faster way, instead just waiting there. The employees should let him know when he should be there. To be continued ...
